## JQUERY
jQuery is a JavaScript file you include in your pages. 
Once included, it makes it faster and easier to write cross-browser JavaScript, based on two steps: 
Using CSS-style selectors to collect one or more nodes from the DOM tree. 
Using jQuery's built-in methods to work with the elements in that selection. 
jQuery's CSS-style selector syntax makes it easier to select elements to work with. It also has methods that make it easier to traverse the DOM. 
jQuery makes it easier to handle events because the event methods work across all browsers. 
jQuery offers methods that make it quick and simple to achieve a range of tasks that JavaScript programmers commonly need to perform. 

### WHY USE JQUERY? 
jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.
