### EJS Partials
Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you don’t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.
Our blog will consist of a home page which lists all the blog posts and a post page which will display a single post.
 The <%- %> tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -). This is important when using the include() statement since you don’t want EJS to escape your HTML characters like ‘<’, ‘>’
 creating and including partials is very straightforward with EJS. I’ve intentionally left in some placeholders such as LIST_OF_POSTS, POST_TITLE, POST_AUTHOR, and POST_CONTENT so that we can take a look at how we can pass data from our Node + Express application to our views in the next section.
